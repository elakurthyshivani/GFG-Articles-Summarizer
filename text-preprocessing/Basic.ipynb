       "8772    8772       GeeksforGeeks     easy    Consider the following partial Schedule S involving two transactions T1 and T2. Only the read and the write operations have been shown. The read operation on data item P is denoted by read(P) and the write operation on data item P is denoted by write(P).\\n\\nSuppose that the transaction T1 fails immediately after time instance 9. Which one of the following statements is correct? (A) T2 must be aborted and then both T1 and T2 must be re-started to ensure transaction atomicity (B) Schedule S is non-recoverable and cannot ensure transaction atomicity (C) Only T2 must be aborted and then re-started to ensure transaction atomicity (D) Schedule S is recoverable and can ensure atomicity and nothing else needs to be done Answer: (B) Explanation:\\nif transaction fails, atomicity requires effect of transaction to be undone. Durability states that once transaction commits, its change cannot be undone (without running another, compensating, transaction). Recoverable schedule: A schedules exactly where, for every set of transaction Ti and Tj. If Tj reads a data items previously written by Ti, then the commit operation of Ti precedes the commit operation of Tj. Aborting involves undoing the operations and redoing them since by the time stamp it is aborted.\\nOption (A) : T2 must be aborted and then both T1 and T2 must be re-started to ensure transaction atomicity. It is incorrect because it says abort transaction T2 and then redo all the operations. But there is no guarantee that it will succeed this time as again T1 may be fail.\\nOption(B) : Schedule S is non-recoverable and cannot ensure transaction atomicity. Correct, it is by definition an irrecoverable schedule so now even if we start to undo the actions one by one(after t1 fails) in order to ensure transaction atomicity. Still we cannot undo a committed transaction. hence this schedule is irrecoverable by definition and also not atomic since it leaves the database in an inconsistent state. Simply dirty read so nonrecoverable.\\nOption (C) : Only T2 must be aborted and then re-started to ensure transaction atomicity. It is incorrect because it says abort only transaction T2 and then redo all the T2 operations. But this is dirty read problem as it is reading the data item A which is written by T1 and T1 is not committed. Again it will be the dirty read problem. So incorrect.\\nOption (D) : Schedule S is recoverable and can ensure transaction atomicity and nothing else needs to be done. Incorrect, it is clearly saying that schedule s is recoverable but it is irrecoverable because T2 read the data item A which is written by T1 and T1 failed and rollback, at the rollback T1 start undo all operations and modified the value of A with previous value but T2 is already committed so T2 can’t change the read value of A which was earlier taken from T1.\\n\\nThis solution is contributed by Nitika Bansa .

Given two strings in the form of linked lists you were to find the lexicographical greatest string. Solution : GeeksforGeeks Link You were given an array and you were supposed to find the number of elements which is/are largest among all elements present in the right side of that particular element in the array. Solution : GeeksforGeeks Link It was a question related to BP+Bitmask. I don’t remember the exact question.\\nAround 27 students were selected from the coding round and were called for further interview rounds. Round 1(Face-To-Face)\\nThe interviewer was very friendly.He asked me to introduce my self\\nThen he asked me some question : Find the maximum cost in traversing a 2-D matrix from one given cell to another. It is same as Min Cost Path DP problem. He asked me to write a code for this. GeeksforGeeks Link Rod Cutting DP I gave him an approach and he was satisfied with this. Then he asked me to write the code. Solution : GeeksforGeeks Link Left view of Binary Tree I gave him an approach and he was happy with approach. After this I was asked to write the code. Solution : GeeksforGeeks Link After these questions he went on for some theoretical questions related to OOPS, DBMS, OS etc.\\nHe asked basic questions like polymorphism and its types. Then, about Normalization and its types with example. He also asked questions related to semaphores.\\nRound 2(Face To Face 2)\\nThe interviewer was very friendly.He asked me to introduce my self and about my hobby. He then moved on to the theoretical concepts of subjects. He asked me questions related to DBMS(transactions and its properties-ACID, about normalization with examples, indexing), OS(paging, segmentation, difference between process and thread etc). After this he moved to my project, he asked me to give brief idea about my project. He asked questions related to my project(SQL vs No SQL, Node-Js concepts etc.). Then he asked me a simple coding question with certain constraints and I solved it. He was very happy with my solution. At the last he gave me a puzzle to which I couldn’t solve.\\n\\nRound 3(Technical+Managerial)\\nThe interviewer was very friendly. He went through my resume and asked about my interest and extra co-curricular activities. After this he asked about my aims, and other HR’s like questions. He asked few project related questions and this was all for this round.\\n\\nRound 4(HR)\\nThe interviewer was very friendly. She asked me to introduce myself.\\nShe asked about my hobby. After this few questions like Why Paytm? etc. This was non-tech round. She wanted to check your nature, attitude and team work skills. Then I was asked to wait for the results.\\nVerdict – Selected 🙂\\nA big thank you to GeeksforGeeks for providing such invaluable material for preparation.  10 Jan, 2019                                       https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paytm-interview-experience-on-campus-for-fte/                                         Paytm Interview experience (On-Campus) for FTE\n",

The cut-off was 7 CGPA throughout and eligible departments were CSE, ECE and EE.\\n1. Online coding round This round was an online coding round in which one question with 50 test cases was to be solved in 3 hours on Samsung’s own software. You have to pass all the 50 test cases in order to qualify this round. The question was this -> Busrt balloon to maximize coins .\\n22 out of 70 candidates were shortlisted for the next round.\\n2. Technical Interview The Interview started with a little discussion on one of my projects, mainly to know whether I have worked on Application and Development domain or not. He then asked me to rate myself in c and c++ and I said 7, which he didn’t appreciate much. :p He started with very basic C and C++ like what are Storage Classes and What is the use of register keyword and Gradually he started going into depth like why does using it make the program faster. Then he asked what happens if we try to find the factorial of a very large number through recursion and then asked me what other ways can it be solved. I gave him total 3 solutions and he was satisfied. Few more questions from Data Structures and Algorithms, dynamic Programming, like What will be the time complexity of Removing an element from a Min Heap, Practical Implementation of Stack, BFS and DFS traversal of a graph. One interesting question was that In how many minimum number of rolls of a dice can we reach the destination in the game of snake and ladder. He asked about my approach to solve this and at first I was blank but the Interviewer was quite helpful and he explained me the question again and gave enough time to think and ultimately I came up with a Solution and he was convinced with it. They were also asking about the solution of the Question in the coding round to everyone.\\nI was able to answer all of the questions he asked and he was quite impressed with me and sent me directly to the Hr round.\\nFor some candidates, they took 2 or 3 technical rounds also. So, you might have to face more than one technical round if they are not satisfied with you.\\n14 out of 22 candidates were selected for the hr round.\\n3. HR Interview It started with the standard ‘Tell me about yourself’ question and I basically told her everything that I have was there in my CV and apart from projects, there were many co-curricular activities I was involved in which she seemed impressed about. Then she asked what are my expectations from the company and where do I see myself in coming few years. Then few questions about my family and that was it.\\n13 out of 14 candidates were given the job offer and I was one of them. 🙂\\nI would like to thank geeksforgeeks which helped me a lot in interview preparation.  18 Jul, 2019  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/samsung-delhi-interview-experience-on-campus-for-software-engineer-september-2018/  Samsung Delhi Interview Experience (On-Campus for Software Engineer) – September 2018\n",
